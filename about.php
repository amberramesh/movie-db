          With the average movie’s runtime hovering around the 2-hour mark, choosing a movie to spend time and sometimes money can be a daunting experience for many.

          Sitting through a bad movie is not only a difficult exercise. It also leaves behind a bad aftertaste that serves as a reminder of the valuable time lost.

          Websites like IMDb and TMDb solve the continuous dilemma movie-viewers regularly face by providing online databases that house movie and movie-related information. These online databases not only contain an exhaustive list of movies across different industries, languages, studios and genres, they also provide a platform for users to offer their feedback in the form of ratings and reviews. These opinions are extremely valuable as they allow people to get an idea of the quality of direction, acting, narrative and screenplay that make the movie which helps them in choosing movies more easily.

          Through “MovieDB”, the intention is to get an idea about what is required to build and maintain such a comprehensive online database that attracts movie-viewers from different spheres of life.
