This is perhaps the only Superman film with the best narrative of the Kryptonian\'s heritage and history. Good casting and an impressive performance by Russell Crowe.

I am a big fan of action and superhero movies, and this did not disappoint. First of all I thought they did a great job on casting Superman. Henry Cavill fits the role perfectly. I liked the supporting cast, except thought they could have done better with Lois Lane. The plot starts out with Superman (Kal-El) being born, and quickly jumps into him being in his 20\'s and saving people. They show some of his growing up, through flashbacks but I wish they would have done more of this. You don\'t have to see any previous Superman movies to see this one, you get the whole back story. There was a ton of good action scenes, almost too much I thought. Plot was pretty good, but also pretty predictable. I saw the 3-D version, and I am not a big fan of 3-D. While this movie did not give me a headache, like \'The Hobbit\', I didn\'t think the 3-D added that much, and I would recommend seeing the 2-D version! Overall I gave it a 9/10.

There is enough silliness, adventure, and romance to allow boys and girls of almost all ages to love this show. There were some funny lines in the show that kids would not understand, but adults would enjoy. I heard a gentleman laughing throughout the whole show. I am not around teenagers, so I am not sure how a teenager would respond to this show. The storyline was different but predictable. That should not discourage anyone from going to this show.

You can make a great animated movie without resorting to actual hand drawn art. But where is that old feeling we all use to share? Well i can tell you this much....i already knew that Disney had something special here, mainly because the VP of PIXAR jumped ship and decided to fund this project.

To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist\'s opus. Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood.

One can\'t help but feel the atrocities were greatly toned down for this film thus not really reflecting the true horror of what really happened, and he fails completely in exploring the character of Schindler. Why did Schindler do what he did? The man was a philanderer and a shrewd business man who didn\'t exactly go out of his way to be nice. Did witnessing what he did make him wake up to himself or perhaps there was an ulterior motive? Spielberg looks at none of this and serves up a modern day saint. It is kind of ironic that Spielberg shot this movie in black and white because that is the approach he has taken to his subject material. He gives us the saintly Schindler, the stereotypical evil Nazi, the honourable Jew and none of the complexities that made these people what they are. This was Spielberg\'s attempt to become accepted as a serious film-maker but yet he takes exactly the same approach to making this as he did with his marvellous popcorn movies resulting in a rather dictatorial film that has more answers than questions!','2004-03-09'),(0,'006',8.5,'Schindler\'s List is undoubtedly the best Holocaust film ever made. There just isn\'t anything like this film. Various other films have tried to show the true horrors of the Holocaust, but none of them succeeded the way that Schindler\'s List did. Schindler\'s List is a difficult film to watch. When you see the true atrocities of the Holocaust, your jaw drops. When you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through, the only thing you can do is cry. The true goal of all Holocaust films is to make you feel sorrowful, and Schindler\'s List did that to me.

Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience.

Not reality.','2018-10-30'),(0,'009',3.0,'This was less of a movie more of a political rant, at the heart of it lay a black community riddled by a societal lack of opportunity, violent gangs, drug culture and endemic gun use.','2018-12-30'),(0,'009',9.0,'I Just saw a secret screening of this movie , I didn\'t know it was going to be this film , so I had no expectations and went in with a clear mind. All I can say is wow, you will be taken on a ride on all different emotions and come out the cinema feeling touched. This movie is not a huge blockbuster and not alot people will know how about it but people should know about it and it\'s a movie everyone should see!','2018-12-25'),(0,'010',8.0,'A solid film, well placed jokes, good scares for the kids, an ok story, CGI was on par for today\'s standards, would recommend this movie to friends and family','2018-10-29'),(0,'010',6.0,'The original Goosebumps movie took me by surprise when it came out in 2015. It had fun likable characters and a great villain in Slappy the evil dummy. ','2018-11-29'),(0,'012',9.0,'I was amazed to see so many negative reviews; so many people are impossible to please. This movie was 2 1/2 hours long, but I could have sat there another 2 1/2 hours and not noticed. Thoroughly entertaining, and I love how the directors weren\'t afraid to take chances. I\'ve read a lot of other user reviews that claim that there\'s no plot. Unless you\'re mentally handicapped or not paying attention because you\'re on your phone the entire movie, the plot is pretty clear, and decent in my opinion.','2018-04-03'),(0,'012',8.5,'This movie has made me feel things that I haven\'t about a movie in a very long time. If you are anything like me you will definitely feel a sense of \"everything is gonna be alright\" because of the generous sprinkling of light humour that makes the situation feel less serious than it actually is. The emotional roller coaster that begins right at the beginning of the movie to the very end has you feeling more and more frustrated and on edge as it goes on. Don\'t get me wrong this movie is absolutely stunning and amazing and a cliffhanger at the end has you wanting more and more. I\'m definitely very excited to see how this storyline will carry out in the next Avengers movie.','2018-04-03'),(0,'012',7.0,'Film was entertaining, ive watched all marvel movies multiple times. This film is great fun but is far to rushed, of cause with so many characters involved was always going to be a tough one to do, part 2 may improve it.','2018-04-04'),(0,'012',1.0,'This movie was litterly the same as the avengers and civil war. Nothing new here except that the hype is getting stronger??? By rules of nature hype must die down over time but marvel fanboys want more bad movies? Disney\'s board of director\'s and their shareholders are laughing their ass off. They acquire the rights of a universe with some superheroes en then they release 5 superhero movies a year that are complete and utter trash but its fanbase will love it no matter wat. now a cgi war movie (were we all now how of how it will end, it doesn\'t becouse Disney will keep spitting out these movies until marvel fanboys stop going to these trash movies.) Is considerd better than movies like Silence of the Lambs, Se7en, forrest gump and Leon??? Well if this is the case than i will leave this site and never come back becouse i use this site to see if a movie is worth seeing. But if a crap movie like this is considerd to be as good as THE GODFATHER!!! then i can no longer trust this site and will de-recommend it to everyone that wants to use it for the same purpose as i did.','2018-04-05'),(0,'011',6.0,'I was looking foward to the crossover movie of Joaquin Phoenix and Jake Gyllenhaal where they prove to not just be the same person this whole time, and i would be lying if I said it didn\'t deliver in that regard. But this movie... was just okay. The performances all around were stellar, with Gyllenhaal and Joaquin completely getting lost in their roles. John C. Riley was good... half of the time, the other half was just Steve Brule in a cowboy hat. Throughout the movie i just kept thinking to myself, \"so when are we gonna start wrapping up?\" That\'s not a good sign. Don\'t get me wrong - where this movie goes and each scene in of itself is pretty good, the film just lacks real momentum. The film doesn\'t really go anywhere, which would be fine if there was a central theme for the spiraling story. But The ending was kinda poop, so that doesn\'t help. I enjoyed watching it and the directions it took, but it never felt complete to me. Everything about this movie (except the exceptional performances) were just fine. Go see if you want an enjoyable and unpredictable western with good performances, but if you\'re hoping for this movie to prove itself as a treasure of cinema, you\'ll be sadly mistaken. 6/10','2018-09-30');
